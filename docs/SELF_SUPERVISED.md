**Unsupervised learning for learning representations from high-dimensional data**. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) learns representations by predicting the future in latent space using autoregressive models. The method uses a probabilitic contrastive loss based on Noise Constrastive Estimation (NCE) which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. The authors show that this technique is applicable to speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.
